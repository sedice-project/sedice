# Discrimination Explained: Field and Laboratory Experiments


## What is our project about?

------

This project aims to explore and explain a phenomenon that we propose to call *misrecognitive discrimination*. Discrimination is misrecognitive when it functions to communicate  disrespect or disesteem for someone belonging to another group.



## Main objectives

------

In this project, we want to identify objective interpersonal behaviours  indicative of misrecognitive discrimination. Moreover, we want to  investigate the proximate socio-emotional mechanisms underlying these  interpersonal behaviours as well as their adaptive function in social  relationships. The latter objective also entails an examination of the  social and emotional impact of misrecognitive discrimination on the  targets of such behaviours.



## Methodology

------

Our project combines field, laboratory, and online experiments. The field  experiments consist in observational studies conducted in the public  transport systems of Paris, Brussels, and Vienna. These experiments  feature social interactions with confederates wearing a variety of  religious signs and performing simple help requests. The online  experiments involve several questionnaires put in relation with social  perception tasks. Finally, a laboratory experiment further investigates  the relations between emotionality and social behaviour by measuring  peripheral physiology and nonverbal social signals.
